This Project is based on my knowledge of intermediate JavaScript to add functionality to any websites


An interactive drum kit website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can play different drum sounds by clicking on instrument buttons or pressing corresponding keyboard keys — just like playing a real drum set!


🎯 Features - 
Multiple drum sounds (snare, kick, toms, crash, hi-hat, etc.)

Click or keyboard interaction

Smooth visual feedback on button press

Fully responsive layout


🛠️ Tech Stack - 
HTML – Structure of the web page and buttons

CSS – Styling, layout, and animations

JavaScript – Sound playback, key detection, and UI interaction

 Sounds Used - 
All drum sound files are stored locally . Each key/button is mapped to a specific instrument.

 Acknowledgements - 
Inspired by simple browser-based instruments and learning-focused JavaScript projects.
